This directory contains code for doing feel good tests on the TASP VSIPL
Implementation. Not every function is tested, this is a work in progress.

type "make test_all" in the testing directory to make the biggest test.

Generally you sould be able to go to a directory, type "make test_all", and 
run the resulting executable (after you have made VSIPL of course). 

These tests require a private library for printing. If you made VSIPL from
the top level the library should be already made. If not, go to src_VU and type
make.

In general output from test_all is verbose and should be piped to a file. The 
file can be searched for "error" to see if there are any problems. There
is a lot of output, so trying to read it line by line would be boring 
unless your only testing a couple of functions.

To test just one function look at "atest.c" which is available in the subdirectories
of testing. 

For more information read the README in the test_scp_simple directory.
