Not ready for prime time so unless you know what you are doing, suggest
skiping this example.

NOTE DISCLAIMER: I know very (very) little about Xwindows.

NOTE: On systems which run Xwindows "someplace" there should be a directory 
called X11R6 (or something similar). In this directory should be a ./lib with
the standard X libraries and a ./include with the headers. In the Makefile
set RXDIR equal to this location. On my PowerBook running OSX it is
/usr/X11R6
but I have found it in all kinds of places on various machines.

To Make VUX library you must go to 
./src_VU/graphics/X_f
and make it directly.  It is not made by default like libVU.a is.
NOTE ./ is the top level of this distribution, not the directory this readme is in.
