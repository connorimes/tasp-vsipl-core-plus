This is a very messy example.


Filter in file [a]
data in file [b]

usage

firEx <length_of_data_segment> <dec> [a] < [b]

example
firEx 10 3 filter <indata

or for complex
cfirEx 10 3 cfilter <cindata

The complex filter and data files are just real complex pairs

real imaginary
real imaginary
etcReal etcImagingary

NOTE the <length_of_data_segment> is not the amount in the data file,
but the length you want processed on each call to firflt.

NOTE the filter is passed as an argument giving the file name.

NOTE the input data to be filtered is at stdin
and the output is at stdout

Not well tested. core dumps if the right arguments aren't passed.

Must pass a decimation factor less than the length of the filter.
This may be a bug, although decimation factors greater than the 
length of the filter are probably a mistake.
